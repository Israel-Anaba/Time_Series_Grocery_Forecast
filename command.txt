1. This error occurs because the execution policy of PowerShell is preventing the activation script from running. To resolve this issue, you can change the execution policy to allow the script to run. Here's how you can do it:

Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on the PowerShell icon and selecting "Run as administrator."

2. Run the following command to check the current execution policy:

...powershell Get-ExecutionPolicy...



...powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned...
